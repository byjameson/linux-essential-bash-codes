# linux-essential-bash-codes
Hello, im working for ai on linux and all commands which i need, im giving you. These codes are enough to make everyrthing on Linux. These are Linux Essential Bash Codes

cd /home => goes to home folder

cd ../ => leaves from home 

htop => shows process and everything on linux, you can see all process and that secreen is clickable so you can filter it on click with mouse, click on command section.

top => basics of top. you can see usage of % cpu. you cant see how much % cpu usage on htop. so we are using top to see it.

nohup COMMAND & => for example, nohup php showStart.php & => it starts showStart.php in background so you dont have to wait it.

kill => you can kill a proccess , usage => kill 13840, it means kill process id of 13840. Where do you see process id? You can see it on htop or you can use "ps aux | grep show.php" it means gives me regex match show.php processes.

ps aux | grep example.php => it means gives me regex match show.php processes.

pkill -f 'example.php' => for example you have 1000 process and you want to kill all of them. you cant do orderly it manually so you can use, pkill -f 'example.php' , it kill all example.php regex match processes.

clear => it clears terminal so you can use easily.

THATS ALL. These codes are enough to make everything on linux.
